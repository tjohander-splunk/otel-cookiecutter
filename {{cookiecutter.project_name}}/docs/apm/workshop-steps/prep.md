# Log in to your Splunk Observability account to identify token/realm

For individuals and groups- allow 30-45 minutes of prep time to identify account credentials and prepare a lab environment. When running as a group we recommend doing a separate prep meeting before running the workshop together.

Check your [Splunk Observability Account](https://app.us1.signalfx.com/o11y/#/home) (your welcome email has this link) and identify your **TOKEN** and **REALM** - these are available in the profile menu in your Splunk Observability account. Note that the realm component i.e. `us1` may be different for your account based on how you signed up.

How to find realm:

`Splunk Observability Menu -> Your Name -> Account Settings`

## Create Lab Environment  

Splunk Observability is for **server environments**. This workshop uses **Ubuntu Linux** as the lab server environment. You can use any Ubuntu platform - bare metal, VM, or cloud VM.

### Recommended Environment

For optimal learning we recommend that you use a fresh cloud VM running Ubuntu with minimum 12GB RAM and 20GB disk space.  

Splunk provdes AWS EC2 [setup/bootstrap scripts via Terraform](https://github.com/signalfx/observability-workshop/tree/master/aws/ec2). Also, [`cloud-init`](https://github.com/signalfx/observability-workshop/blob/master/cloud-init/k3s.yaml) YAML files are available for Multipass.

If you chose your own Ubuntu machine, you can set it up with the Workshop software with this command:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/signalfx/otelworkshop/master/setup-tools/ubuntu.sh)
```

### How To Build An Ubuntu VM on your Windows or Mac PC

If you cannot procure a cloud VM, you can create an Ubuntu Linux environment on a Mac or PC and install the necessary software components

### Mac OS

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Make sure Homebrew is fully upgraded:

```bash
brew upgrade
```

Results should be at least 1.5:

```bash
brew --version
```

We will use [Multipass](https://multipass.run) as a hypervisor for Mac:

```bash
brew cask install multipass
```

If needed, further instructions are [here](https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-macos). Do one final brew upgrade before spinning up VM:

```bash
brew upgrade
```

### Windows

Follow Multipass Windows installation [instructions](https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-windows)

### Launch Multipass Ubuntu VM

Create your VM called "primary":

```bash
multipass launch -n primary -d 20G -m 12G -c4
```

This will download Ubuntu and may take a few minutes the first time.

Basic multipass commands:

- Shell into VM: `multipass shell primary`  
- Exit VM: `exit`

To manage multipass VM:

- `multipass stop primary` stops the VM
- `multipass delete primary` deletes the VM from the hypervisor  
- `multipass purge` purges created images but leaves the ubuntu template intace  

### Install OTel Workshop

A bootstrap script will install everything needed and clone this repo.  
This will take up to 10 minutes to execute- leave it running until complete.  

```bash
multipass shell primary
```

Once in your Multipass Ubuntu VM:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/signalfx/otelworkshop/master/setup-tools/ubuntu.sh)
```

## Key OTel APM concepts

Moving parts that make APM happen in OpenTelemetry:

- **Application Spans:** OpenTelemetry instrumentation causes spans to be emitted by your applications OpenTelmetry auto-instrumentation (no code changes) for most languages is availabile but you can use any framework/library that emits spans in formats accepted by the Otel Collector i.e zipkin, OpenTracing, or [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemtry.io). The spans are received by the OpenTelemetry Collector which both doubles as an infrastructure metrics collection agent and a telemetry processor. The Collector then forwards all telemetry (metrics/traces/logs) to Splunk Observability Cloud.  
- **Instructructure metrics:** Infrastructure metrics are collected by your OpenTelemetry Collector which is observing the application's host or container cluster. The infrastructure agent is lightweight, open source, real-time, and designed for microservices, containers, and cloud as well as on premise servers or cloud virtual machines.
- Application spans will be sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector running on a host or k8s pod to correlate APM with host/cluster metrics. The Collector then relays the spans to Splunk Observability Cloud APM where they will be assembled into traces.  
- The APM spans flow in real time and there is no sampling. Pre-made default Service Dashboards with application metrics for each app will appear once spans are received by Splunk APM. The APM view has directed troubleshooting.  
- Environment variables control the setup of APM. These names vary based on instrumentation but they always include:  
  - **Endpoint**: destination to send spans  
  - **Service name**: the name of the application as you want it to appear in a service map  
  - **Environment**: a value for segmenting betwen dev/prod etc. Can be set with instrumentation and not necessarily as part of an ENV variable.
