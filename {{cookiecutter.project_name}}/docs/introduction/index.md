# Introduction

The Splunk OpenTelemetry Workshop will teach you how to level up your Observability practice by using the OpenTelemetry Collector and APM Instrumentation to emit industry standard telemetry from your infrastructure and applications.

Source repo is here: [https://github.com/signalfx/otelworkshop](https://github.com/signalfx/otelworkshop)

## Requirements

### Audience

- Intermediate and advanced developers, devops, and SREs who have already set up their Splunk Observability Cloud account and have tried out integrations and dashboards Skill level should include setting up and troubleshooting Linux and Kubernetes environments as well as deploying applications written in current versions of Java, Python, Node.
- This workshop is designed to run as a single user, or be run in a small group (upwards of 6) along with a leader guiding the group.
- If running as a group, a pre-workshop prep call is necessary to ensure that all group members can spin up and/or access an Ubuntu Linux lab environment. Details are below.

### Prerequisites

- Completion of [Splunk Observability Workshop](https://signalfx.github.io/observability-workshop/latest/) which trains on using metrics/APM and charts/dashboards/alerts or equivalent devops/SRE skills
- Splunk Observability Cloud Account
- Ability to use a multi-terminal IDE i.e. Microsoft Visual Studio Code or equivalent
- Ability to spin up a VM or access a host with a Debian Linux environment with the following specs: Debian (i.e. Ubuntu) Linux environment with minimum 12G RAM and 20G disk w/ lightweight Kubernetes (Rancher k3s) installed OR your own k8s cluster. The Prep section has some tools to help build a local or AWS environment.

## Document Conventions

Variables from your Splunk Observability account are displayed like this: YOURVARIABLEHERE.
I.e. to change your REALM to `us1` change `api.{{ cookiecutter.realm }}.signalfx.com` to `api.us1.signalfx.com`  

- K8s = Kubernetes
- K3s = a lightweight Kubernetes from [Rancher](https://www.k3s.io)
- signalfx = Splunk Observability domain name/endpoint/technology name
- otel = OpenTelemetry
